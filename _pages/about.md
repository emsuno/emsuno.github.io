Hi, I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html)(world ranking 58), supervised by [Prof. Thomas Seidl](https://www.ifi.lmu.de/dbs/en/persons/contact-page/thomas-seidl-d7ba2a79.html) ([MCML](https://mcml.ai/) Diector, latest service: ACM KDD 2026 SAC). 
I also collaborate with [Prof. Hinrich Schütze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Jiancheng Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TCaWKwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). I maintain close ties with several leading research and industry groups: [Qwen 1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pPLQrX4AAAAJ&hl=en),[2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gRXSf3sAAAAJ&hl=en), [CIS NLP](https://cisnlp.github.io/), and [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/). My research focus is around large vision-langugae models, where I am particularly interested in how VLMs perceive and understand the physical world to develop advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. I believe vision and language are the two fundamental pillars through which humanity perceives and interacts with the physical world. My mission is to bridge VLMs into physical reality, empowering them to perceive and act with human-like understanding.
