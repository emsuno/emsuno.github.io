I am a second-year Ph.D. student at LMU Munich, supervised by [Prof. Thomas Seidl](https://www.ifi.lmu.de/dbs/en/persons/contact-page/thomas-seidl-d7ba2a79.html) ([MCML](https://mcml.ai/) Diector, latest service: ACM KDD 2026 SAC). 
I also collaborate with [Prof. Hinrich Schütze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Jiancheng Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TCaWKwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). I maintain close ties with several leading research and industry groups: [Qwen 1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pPLQrX4AAAAJ&hl=en)[2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gRXSf3sAAAAJ&hl=en), [CIS NLP](https://cisnlp.github.io/about/), and [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/). My research focus is around large vision-langugae models, where I am particularly interested in how VLMs perceive and understand the physical world to develop advanced reasoning and planning capabilities.
